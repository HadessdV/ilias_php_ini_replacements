# ilias_php_ini_replacements
replacing php.ini settings for better ilias functionality

the standard php.ini of apache has some bad settings for working with the learning platform ILIAS
this python-scripts rewrites the settings in the code 
to the php.ini file which MUST BE in the SAME directory as the script

script has a main so just execute the file
